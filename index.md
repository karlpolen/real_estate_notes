# Background

After 40 years of working in real estate, I thought I'd share what I think I know.  To understand where I'm coming from, I think it might be useful to share something about my experience and what I think I've learned.

During these 40 years, I've worked on every property type in multiple jurisdiction across and have played many roles.  I started as an accountant, then became an analyst.  I switched to property operations and worked for a year in a sales position to "round me out" for management roles.  Later I was a chief financial officer, then a chief operating officer and finally a chief investment officer. 

I've worked every kind of transaction.  I've negotiated hundreds of leases, collected the rent and evicted tenants who didn't pay.

# What works 

## Property level dynamics

$Success = Location * Design + Execution$

## Long term hold

Trading real estate is very expensive.  If you buy good properties in the first place, there is no reason to trade them.  

By holding properties, taxes can be deferred indefinitely and in a well structured estate plan the next generation can enjoy a new set of tax advantages through a step up in basis.

# What doesn't work

## Value trap

Value investing is risky in real estate. Just because something is cheap, doesn't mean it's a good value. 

## Closed end fund structures

Enforce an artificial time frame on properties with pressure to buy at the beginning of a fund and compelled selling at the end.  The fund time frame often aligns poorly with business cycles.
