# Abstract

This is an unfiltered compendium of thoughts from 40 years experience developing, operating and investing in real estate.  Organized in three parts -- what works, what doesn't and thoughts for the future.

Perhaps I will polish to a more cohesive article in the future.  But for now, this is it.

# What works 

## Property level dynamics

$Success = Location * Design + Execution$

The formula is written in a way that suggests location and design interact and magnify each other when they work together well.  Execution is equally important, but independent.  A great concept can be ruined by poor execution.

## Hyper local approach to underwriting

### Demand drivers

### Competitition

### New construction

## Product expertise

## Critical mass

## Risk management

## Operational focus

## Construction expertise

## Entitlements expertise

## Long term hold

Trading real estate is very expensive.  If you buy good properties in the first place, there is no reason to sell assets just to buy others.

Refinancings are very efficient liquidity events.  Since they are tax free, you may be able to generate nearly as much spendable cash from a refi as you might from a sale which imposes taxes for depreciation recapture and capital gain.

In a long term hold implementation, taxes can be deferred indefinitely and in a well structured estate plan the next generation can enjoy a new set of tax advantages through a step up in basis.

# What doesn't work

## Value trap

Price per pound is an inadequate underwriting metric.  Sometimes things are cheap for a reason.  Real estate has "falling knives" but they fall slowly.  Some concepts become obsolete.  Sometimes people just pay too much and the next owner buying in a foreclosure should pay little attention to the discount from the last purchase price.
Value investing is risky in real estate. Just because something is cheap, doesn't mean it's a good value. 

## Closed end fund structures

Enforce an artificial time frame on properties with pressure to buy at the beginning of a fund and compelled selling at the end.  The fund time frame often aligns poorly with business cycles.

## CAPM and VaR

# The future

## Big data and machine learning 

### What is success?

### Location dynamics

### Design analysis

### Their interactions

### Investor implications

## Leveraging technology in opeations
