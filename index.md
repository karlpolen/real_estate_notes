# Abstract

This is an unfiltered compendium of thoughts from 40 years experience developing, operating and investing in real estate.  Organized in three parts:`

- why real estate
- what works in real estate
- technology opportunities 

Perhaps I will polish to a more cohesive article in the future.  But for now, this is it.

# Why real estate?

## Investment characteristics

Real estate is an essential part of the productive capacity of any economy and, therefore, has intrinsic investment merit.  It's a "core" asset, not an alternative asset.

Real estate is always there even though companies come an go.  While the stock market as a whole will always be there, the average time an individual company is listed on the stock is less than ten years.  The Empire State Building and stocks in the CRSP database both originate around 90 years ago.  The building is still there and relevant in its market, while only a handful of the companies around in 1930 are still there today.

This makes real estate a good store of value and a reliable to earn steady rents, all of it reasonably well protected from inflation.  The yields of real estate are attractive compared to core bonds with 10yr treasury currently (late 2020) below 1%.

As a bonus, the tax attributes are very favorable.  Current income is shielded from tax by depreciation.  Coupled with a well structured estate plan, taxes on capital gains can be deferred indefinitely and the next generation can enjoy a new round of tax benefits through a step up in basis.

When levered to around 50%, the expected returns of high quality real estate are roughly comparable to index returns in the stock market.  So, a balanced portfolio of stocks and real estate seems attractive for income generation, capital appreciation and wealth preservation.  

## Industry Structure

One of the unique characteristics of real estate is its extraordinarily local character.  If you're an entrepreneur with an idea for a better mousetrap for how a cell phone works, you have to take on Apple and Samsung.  Good luck.  While it's not impossible to disrupt a market like this (Apple did it to Motorola and Nokia), it can *only* be done on a global scale.  

Contrast that to real estate, where you can be relevant and very successful on a local, even neighborhood, scale.  If you have a nuanced understanding of a place like Los Angeles, it's not one market.  It's a hundred markets and a good entrepreneur can be relevant and successful in any one of them.

This creates tremendous opportunity but has implications for how you think about investing in the sector.

# What works 

## The fundamental law of real estate

is *not* location, location, location

It's this:

$Success = Location * Design + Trend + Value + Execution$

Taken together, location and design constitute quality in real estate.  But they are not the same thing.  The formula is written with a multiplication symbol between them to show that location and design interact and magnify each other when they work together well. 

Trend reflects the direction of underlying conditions.  The broad economy is highly differentiated with certain regions, industry segments and population doing much better than others.  Ignoring that is a mistake.  These trends create high risks of obsolescence.  Therefore, absolute value approaches to investing with regard to quality and trend risks big mistakes.   

Value (i.e. entry price) is important because you can overpay for an asset and that is hard to overcome.  Therefore, value has to be viewed in the context of quality and is always relative value considering quality.  

Execution is last, but equally important.  A great concept can be ruined by poor execution.  Because of financial and operational leverage, small inefficiencies are magnified in final outcomes.  This is in the category of "death by a thousand cuts".  Individually, operational decisions tend not to be of strategic importance, but collectively they are.  You can achieve "good" results by getting everything else right, but excellence in operations is needed to make it to "great". 

## Hyper local approach to underwriting 

### Demand drivers

Location determines the potential of a property.  The dimensions for understanding location are transportation connectivity, industry connectivity and demographic connectivity.

Transportation potential is measured by walkability, drive times, access to mass transit, and access to air travel.  

We see all sorts of self-organizing and clustering in industry and demographic groups.  Certain neighborhoods or cities are associated with particular industries and activities.  People self organize in neighborhoods around income, ethnic, religious and other factors.  Knowing where your property stands on these dimensions is key to understanding its potential and marketing avenues.  Taking advantage of these clusters and delivering products responsive to preferences of the clusters are key to success.  For example, different ethnic groups have really different preferences in housing features.  Different industries may have very different expectations on office space.  

Collectively these factors shape potential demand for your project.  

### Competition

For every property, you should grasp the "competitive set" that your tenants will be evaluating in competition with your building.  The competitors are likely in the same neighborhood, but not necessarily.  

You assess the pros and cons, consider changes to address deficiencies and formulate business plans based on competitive position.  

With adequate capital, consider buying your competitors so you can gain market share and be a price setter in your hyper-local market segment.

### New construction

It's critical to understand the in-process and potential construction pipeline to grasp your exposure to new competition in your neighborhood and emerging neighborhoods.  While this is pretty obvious in growth markets, this is also true in established markets where preferences and possibilities evolve.  Who'd have thought ten or twenty years ago that Park Avenue buildings would face existential threat from competition on the far west side?  

## Design expertise

If you are going to own buildings, you must understand the features that are valued by and attract tenants.  This is relatively well understood in the developer community and resources for property types are available through organizations like ULI.  

While I think it is a rooky mistake to ignore this, one of the most striking things when I changed side of the aisle to manage institutional real estate investments was the complete blindness of the institutional investment community to this issue.  It's fascinating to go to PREA and then to ULI and see that there is almost no overlap in what they consider worth talking about.  Bizarre.

This was the fundamental incite that led to the approach I ended up following in implementing the ASRS real estate program.  You want to own buildings that are appealing to tenants in fundamental and intrinsic ways.

Design is very subtle and much more than just a checklist of features.  Colors, textures, natural and artificial light acoustic design all have profound psychological impacts on the occupants of a building.  The effect of light on mood is documented in psychological literature.  While they may not be able to verbalize these reactions, it affects their shopping behavior in a retail setting, their productivity in an office and happiness in general.  

## Critical mass

You need to have critical mass in whatever you do.  If you own one building of each property type in a bunch of different markets, you have no opportunity for feedback and learning which can lead to improvement.

Because of the intensely local nature of real estate, you need to be a "player" in whatever market segments you are in.  People with the right local connections are far more likely to be exposed to "off market" situations and will be in a better position to manage political and regulatory mattes that arise with real estate ownership.

You are better off being a little concentrated in your exposure and getting good at a few things rather than owning one thing in every market and category.  At ASRS, all our best investments were with partners who could in some sense be identified as sharp-shooters -- either local market or product specialists.  

## Value

Obviously, entry price matters.  When possible, you want to identify properties "off market" that are managed and valued below their potential.  Finding those situations is hard, but if you have scale and are deeply engaged in your particular market segment you are more likely to be exposed to these situations.

Price per pound, by itself, is an inadequate underwriting metric.  Sometimes things are cheap for a reason.  Real estate has "falling knives" but they fall slowly.  Some concepts become obsolete and some regions or industries face long term decline.  Sometimes people just pay too much and the next owner buying in a foreclosure should pay little attention to the discount from the last purchase price. Just because something is cheap, doesn't mean it's a good value. 

## Control

Some people see control as an opportunity and others see it as a necessary evil.  But I woule advise that you should not give up control because of the difficulties of achieving alignment of interest with management in non-control structures.  

At ASRS we invested in real estate in separate accounts and operating companies with high control features over major decisions of buying, selling and financing properties.  We also invested in "funds" where we were passive.  

With experience over fifteen years and billions invested, the control investments absolutely dominated the performance with returns several hundred basis points above benchmark.  The non-control investments barely kept up with benchmark.

I'm not sure why.  I suspect it's mostly behavioral.  A fund structure amounts to a ten year no-cut employment contract and perhaps that leads to complacency.  For funds that underperform their minimum return requirement and are "out of the money" on carried interest, there definitely is a breakdown in alignment of interest.  We observed again and again that those funds drug on and on as the sponsors milked them for fees.

Additionally, fund structures force an artificial time frame with pressure to buy at the beginning of a fund and compelled selling at the end.  The fund time frame may align poorly with business cycles.

You may not want control, but I'd advise against giving it up.  As I've noted elsewhere, I'd suggest you see this as an opportunity and pursue operational excellence.


## Long term hold

Trading real estate is very expensive.  If you buy good properties in the first place, there is no reason to sell assets just to buy others.

Refinancings are very efficient liquidity events.  Since they are tax free, you may be able to generate nearly as much spendable cash from a refi as you might from a sale which imposes taxes for depreciation recapture and capital gain.

In a long term hold implementation, taxes can be deferred indefinitely and in a well structured estate plan the next generation can enjoy a new set of tax advantages through a step up in basis.

This was the second area where I thought a typical institutional approach to real estate was off the mark.  A typical institutional portfolio is structured in a series of "funds" where everything turns over once every seven to ten years, only to turn around an buy other stuff.  Completely illogical with high transaction costs and misalignment of interests between the investor and asset manager.


## Operational Expertise 

### Construction and building operations

If you are going to own buildings, you need to understand them physically.  Buildings are made of things that wear out and you need to constantly renew them.  

The contracting industry is aligned to exploit naivete.  In order to properly manage a construction or renovation project, you need to have a level expertise to where you know the plans and the construction process as well as the contractor does.  Nightmares happen in construction not because construction is inherently risky but because of failures in management and alignment of interest.  Contractors make money on delays and change orders and break even on base contracts.  The interests of contractors and bulding owners are aligned in opposition.  What is a nightmare for an owner is a dream come true for a contractor.  

### Regulation

Real estate is heavily regulated locally and nationally through environmental, zoning, building codes, tenant protection laws, community association laws and so forth.  Real estate is also benefited by various incentives in tax abatement, municipal financing districts and enterprise zones of various sorts.  You need to be able to navigate to avoid costly surprises and take advantage of any local programs.

# Technology opportunities

## Big data and market analysis

Real estate as an industry has been slow to integrate technology to its practices.  From an investor perspective, the technological sophistication of real estate compared to, say, the stock market is very striking.  

There are good reasons for this.  Because real estate is regulated locally, there is no national registry of properties and the costs of coordinating all the disparate data are high.  Additionally, liquid markets have continuous price discovery and the prices themselves contain a lot of information (arguably all the information if you are an EMH purist).  That doesn't exist in real estate and the absence of continuous price information means you have to gather the demographic, economic and business information that you think are likely to influence success.

"Big data" approaches can be applied to real estate to change the state of the art.  Google maps, for example, provides a base map of all the buildings and those maps can be coordinated with local zoning and infrastructure maps to create a base map of the real estate ecosystem.  This provides a base for understanding the potential connectivity of a site or a building.

That can then be combined with cell phone and social media data to understand the real ( not just the potential) networks that exist among social, demographic and industry groups.

Finally, you could systematically measure building design characteristics and integrate them to this database.  Sentiment analysis of social media posts of building occupants might also lead to useful insights.

With this type of data, you could be systematic about assessing quality factors scoring buildings on their connectivity to wealth, talent, industry groups and social networks.  Those scores could be linked to predictive analytics on potential outcomes.  

### What is success?

Any model needs to have a definition of success, otherwise there is nothing to model and no point to modeling.  This is easy for cases like the stock market where you have continuous price discovery.  Stock returns are the measure of success and you create models to look for what might be driving those results.

In the case of real estate you have appraisal values as a proxy for prices.  Appraisals are dubious as to their accuracy and generally lag in recognizing what is happening on the ground.

I'd suggest that gross revenue (occupancy * sq ft * rental rate) is the better measure of success for this type of modeling exercise.  In the first place it's observable -- rental rates are quoted publicly and databases of rates and occupancy for individual buildings are tracked in commercially available databases.  Second, it's objective and can be tracked more or less in real time.  Finally, it can be converted to value with revenue multipliers in a way that's likely at least as good as appraisals and maybe better.

### Building a model

Once you have a database of buildings, their connectivity attributes and designed attributes linked to rental outcomes you are ready to build a model.  

This is the easy part.  The work flow is pretty straight forward:

-- Cluster the observations to identify market segments
-- Normalize the rental outcomes within segments (to mean zero with standard deviation of 1) so they are comparable across segments.
-- Turn loose your machine learning algorithms to identify relationships that explain rents that are robust across training and testing sets and across market segments.

While this is all pretty blue sky, I think it is actually implementable at far less than "moon shot" type costs.  One approach would be to pick two medium size markets, say Seattle and Denver.  I'd want one of them to have a significant global component and the other to be more local as a challenge to the robustness.  You'd then build the models independently and cross validate them within the two markets.  Finally, you'd run the Seattle model on Denver and vice versa and see how well they work in order to further fine tune them.

### Commercial implications

While it is obvious that properties linked to lots of wealth and lots of talent have more potential than those don't, nobody (to my knowledge) has systematically measured these things.  If they were measured, it may be the case that you could develop predictive analytics that could quantify the potential outcomes for a property.  This could be done comprehensively (more or less) across markets of interest.  Done a proprietary way, this could be used as an "edge" to identify properties performing below potential and target them for acquisition "off market".  For widely marketed properties,
this technology would provide an efficient way to screen packages.

## Technology and market structure

Real estate is expensive to transact because of the cost of intermediaries.  These types of costs were mitigated decades ago in the stock market.  Why is real estate so far behind?

Mostly, I would say because of infrequency of transactions and the presence of local monopolies among intermediaries.

If you have experience with industrial and office property, you undoubtedly have observed an oligopoly structure with a handful of brokers controlling most markets.  Nationally, companies like CBRE and JLL are very dominant in tenant representation.  It's striking to me that tenants aren't more sensitive to the costs that they ultimately bear and the conflicts of interests that arise through landlords offering "bonuses" in addition to standard amounts for access to deal flow.  But nobody, so far, has had the courage to try to break this system.  It is ripe for reform.

One area that does seem promising for disintermediation is commercial mortgage origination.  While this process is also handled through a network of broker originators, the structure of this market is much more diffuse.  I don't know why there isn't a "Rocket mortgage" for mid market commercial loans and this seems like a business worth pursuing.  I would guess that if you identified the top hundred lenders among commercial banks, life companies and debt funds that you would account for 90% or so of mid market loan originations.  All you would need to do is capture the lending criteria for each lender and create an on line application process to match loan requests with the most efficient source of capital.  Borrowers and lenders would have a more efficient process.  Lenders would see more deals.  Borrowers would have access to more lenders, pricing and structures.  Everyone would have lower costs.

The same idea applies to corporate middle market loans where lenders use call centers and correspondent networks to search for loans.


## Technology for operations

Real estate, by and large, has been slow to adopt technology in its operating practices.

Simple financial reporting for asset managers has much room for improvement.  Investors want timely reporting that is incisive in helping understand their portfolios and risks in them and comparable across managers.  What they receive instead is lagged by months, overloaded with irrelevant marketing gloss and cleansed of incisive detail.  There are a number of efforts in this regard, but no clear winner and no leadership in driving  the standards for quality.

With today's technology, accounting and other data collection systems can and should be capturing data on a real time basis in order to develop "metrics" which can then be connected to improve performance on both marketing and operational dimensions.  This type of "moneyball" is practiced by a few exceptional operators, but is an area for potential improvement for most of the real estate industry. 

Construction is run the same way it was fifty years ago.  There has been some focus and press on this, but no clear leader in bringing this to market.  This will be a very tough nut to crack because contractors and trade unions are very powerful groups with a large vested interest in perpetuating inefficiency.  These same groups often have outsize influence in local politics and actively work to discourage cost saving innovation.

Green and smart buildings are an area where there has been progress and market traction.  Tenants expect this and some cities require it.  Building owners should adopt these technologies to improve energy efficiency and create healthy environments for tenants.
